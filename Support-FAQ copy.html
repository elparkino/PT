                <li>How do I add a User to the software?</li>
                <li>How do I edit a User’s information?</li>
                <li>How do I remove a User from the software?</li>
              </ul>
        </ul>
            <p>A “User” is defined as someone who operates the software,  whether it is a teacher or administrator. When you run the software for the  first time, you need to log in as the Administrator using ‘admin’ for both the  user name and the password. The software will run in administrative mode, which  allows you to add, edit, or remove users to the program. We recommend that you  change the administrator password immediately after the first login.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>How do I add a user  to the software?</strong><br />
              1. Log in as an administrator.<br />
              <br />
              2. On the following screen, select “Create User List” and  click “OK”.<br />
              <br />
        3. Select “Add User”. On the following screen, enter the  following information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>User name. For example: “jpublic”</li>
              <li>User password (optional).</li>
              <li>The User’s Proper Name. For example: “Jon Q. Public”</li>
              <li>User ID (optional)</li>
              <li>The User’s School (available in district  editions)</li>
              <li>Permission Level. Whether the user has teacher-,  school-, or district-level permission to the software.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>4. Once you have finished adding a User, click “OK” to be  taken back to the Add, Edit, or Remove User Screen. When you are finished,  click “Done” and then exit the program. The new user may now login with his or  her account.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>How do I edit a  User’s information?</strong><br />
              1. Log in as an administrator.<br />
              2. On the following screen, select “Edit User List” and  click “OK”.<br />
        3. Select “Edit User”. On the following screen, you may edit  the following information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>User name. For example: “jpublic”</li>
              <li>User password (optional).</li>
              <li>The User’s Proper Name. For example: “Jon Q. Public”</li>
              <li>User ID (optional)</li>
              <li>The User’s School (available in district  editions)</li>
              <li>Permission Level. Whether the user has teacher-,  school-, or district-level permission to the software.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>4. Once you have finished editing a User, click “OK” to be  taken back to the Add, Edit, or Remove User Screen. When you are finished,  click “Done” and then exit the program. The new user may now login with his or  her edited account.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>How do I remove a  User from the Software?</strong><br />
              1. Log in as an administrator.<br />
              <br />
              2. On the following screen, select “Edit User List” and  click “OK”.<br />
              <br />
              3. Highlight the User in the User List that you wish to  remove, and click “Remove User”.<br />
              <br />
        4. To confirm removing a User, click “Yes” in the following  window. Note that by removing a user, he or she will lose access to all saved  data, including created tests and reports.</p>

        </ul>
            <p>A class roster allows you to manage student test results and  generate reports. A class may either be entered into the software manually or  imported from a text file.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>To manually create a  new class:</strong><br />
              Click the CREATE A NEW CLASS button. The New Class  Information window will appear on your screen. Name the new class and click OK.  Since you can have multiple classes to manage all of your classes/groups, be  sure to give your classes meaningful names so you will remember which is which.<br />
              After you have created a new class, you will want to  populate it with the student members of that class. To do so, click the MANAGE  CLASSES AND STUDENTS button in the Classes section of the Progress Monitor main  screen.<br />
  <strong>How do I create  students?</strong><br />
  <br />
              Click on the ADD STUDENT button in the Student Information  screen. A window will appear allowing you to enter a student name along with  optional class, ID, grade, demographic, and NCLB data.<br />
              The Demographics options (Gender, Ethnicity, Economically  Disadvantaged, Disabilities, Limited English Proficiency, and Migrant Status)  match NCLB categories for Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) tracking.<br />
              Once you have entered the student information, click OK. The  student will now appear in the class roster.<br />
              <br />
  <strong>How do I edit student  information?</strong><br />
              To edit a student's information, simply select the student  from the list. The student's information will appear in the fields to the right  of the student list. You can change any and all information by double-clicking  on the student's name or clicking EDIT THIS STUDENT. When finished editing,  click SAVE to save the changes. If you do not want to save the changes, click  CANCEL.<br />
              <br />
  <strong>How do I remove a  student from a class?</strong><br />
              To remove a student from the class roster, select the  student in the list and then click REMOVE THIS STUDENT. Because there is no way  to undo this action, the program will always ask you to make sure you want to  remove the student before completing the command.<br />
              <br />
  <strong>How do I import a  student list?</strong><br />
              The software supports importing student information from a  text file which can simplify the process of setting up class rosters. The file  must be in text format and can either use tabs or commas to separate field  values, i.e. tab delimited or CSV.<br />
              <br />
              To set up a file for import manually, open Notepad or any  plain text editor. Type your fields (Last Name, First Name, Grade, etc.) on the  first line, using the 'Tab' key to separate the fields. (Or if you like, you  can leave out the field headings and start with student information on the first  line.) Fill in information for all students. Make sure that even if you do not  have data for a particular field, you include a tab for the blank field. There  must be the same number of tabs for each line or the file will not load  properly. Save the file as a text (.txt) file.<br />
              <br />
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> The easiest manner in which to import student information is  to export it from your current grade book or Student Information System (SIS).  Most popular grade book programs support exporting to a tab-delimited text file  or CSV file. Check your grade book program's export options, as this feature  could save you an abundance of time. For advanced users—The import supports a  Class ID field for filtering student records by class ID. This can be used to  import student records from a master list created by exporting from your SIS.  When this field is selected the software asks you to enter a class ID which is  then used to filter student records.<br />
              To import students, click either CREATE A NEW CLASS to  create a new class or MANAGE CLASSES AND STUDENTS to open an existing class.  Select the class you want to import to and click ADD/EDIT/IMPORT STUDENTS. This  will take you to the Student Information screen. From here, click IMPORT  STUDENTS FROM FILE. Then, click BROWSE and select the text file you want to  import.<br />
              <br />
              After selecting the file, select the number of fields on  each line, and then select the data type for each field. Import and export of  students in the software includes all NCLB flags. For each field you can  assign: First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, ID, Grade, Gender, Ethnicity,  Economically Disadvantaged, Disabilities, Limited English Proficiency, Migrant  Status, or Skip (to skip a field, if information was exported from another  system or program and the field does not apply in the software). This way, the  software will bypass this column and skip to the next field.<br />
              <br />
              Check SKIP THE FIRST LINE at the top of the screen if you  would like the program to bypass reading the field headings on the first line,  if they are included in your file. Check IGNORE STUDENTS WITH IDENTICAL NAMES  if you already have some student records in the program and don’t want  duplicates.<br />
              <br />
  <strong>How do I export a  student list?</strong><br />
        From the Student Information screen, click EXPORT STUDENTS  TO FILE. Choose where you would like to save the text file and click SAVE. All  students on the class list will be exported. You now have a saved tab-delimited  text file of your class list that you can share with other teachers or use with  other compatible programs. Note that test scores for the student are not a part  of this export.<br />

          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Installing the  Software on a Network</strong><br />
          The Network version of the software runs in a shared folder  on the server. All of the files needed to run the program as well as all the  user data files are stored in this shared folder on the server. To run the software  at a workstation, the user navigates to the shared folder on the server and  launches the program from there. A shortcut can be created on individual  workstations to simplify this step. Please note that this program does not use  any form of network communications (TCP/IP, etc.) so it will not be affected by  firewalls or other related security software.<br />
          <br />
          1. The Administrator / IT person should install the software  on the server using the CD. Create a folder on the server and give it an  appropriate name (i.e. “FCAT Test Maker” or “STAAR Test Maker”), then copy all  of the files from CD into the newly created folder.<br />
          <br />
          2. Make the software folder a shared folder. Right click on  the installed software folder and select “Sharing and Security”. Select “Share  this folder on the network” and “Allow network users to change my files”. Set  the share name to an appropriate abbreviation of the folder, such as “FTM” or  “STM”. Please note that if you set the share name greater than 12 characters,  you will have problems running on workstations with Windows 98, ME, or NT 4.0.<br />
          <br />
          3. Run the software for the first time. You will need to log  on as the Administrator using the word “admin” for both the user name and the  password. You are now in the administrative mode, which allows you to Add,  Edit, or Remove Users and to change the administrative password. We recommend  that you change the administrator password immediately.<br />
          <br />
          4. While in the administrator mode, add one or more users.  For each user enter a user name and a password. If a user forgets their  password at some point in the future, use the “Edit User” feature to enter a  new password. Once you have finished adding one or more users, exit the  program. To log on as the administrator in the future, use “admin” as the user  name and the current administrator password.<br />
          <br />
          5. Now that one or more users have been set up, you can  begin using the program over the network. At his/her workstation, the user  should navigate to the shared folder and run the software, preferably from the  shortcut. They will be asked for their user name and password. Upon successful  entry, the full program is ready to use by that user. All of a user’s data is  stored in a unique folder on the server and is accessible regardless of which  workstation they are using. Multiple users can be logged in at the same time,  but each user can only be logged on from one workstation at a time. To see  which user is currently logged on at a given workstation, select the File menu  and look for an item that begins with “Logged in as ...”.<br />
          <br />
  <strong>Individual  Workstation Installation</strong><br />
          Here’s how you install the software on and Individual  Computer:<br />
          1. Insert the CD into your computer.<br />
          <br />
          2. Click on the Start Menu, then click “My Computer.” Right  click on the CD icon and select “Open”. Leave the window open for now. (Note  that double clicking the CD icon will open the Network Installation  Instructions in your browser.)<br />
          <br />
        3. Click on your Desktop, then Right-click and select “New”  and then “Folder”. We suggest giving the folder the same name as the software,  such as “FCAT Test Maker” or “STAAR Test Maker” (without the quotes). Leave  this window open, as well.<br />
        <br />
          4. Go back and select the opened CD window, click “Edit” in  your Menu Bar and click “Select All”. Alternatively, you can press the “CTRL”  and “A” buttons. All of the items in the CD window should now be highlighted.<br />
          <br />
          5. Copy the selected items. With all items still selected,  copy the items by clicking “Edit” in your menu bar and clicking “Copy”. Alternatively,  you can press the “CTRL” and “C” buttons.<br />
          <br />
          6. Select your new folder (the one you created on your  desktop), then click “Edit” in your Menu bar and click “Paste”. Alternatively,  you can press the “CTRL” and “V” buttons. The items on the CD are now copying to  the new folder. A “Copying” window will appear. Wait for the items to write  from the CD to your computer.<br />
          <br />
          7. When the items are finished copying, you have now  installed the software. The folder may stay on your desktop, or you may move  the folder to your “Program Files” folder on your hard drive and creating a  desktop shortcut to the software.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Installing Your  Software Upgrade</strong><br />
          BEFORE YOU UPGRADE: Do NOT delete your old software  installation.<br />
          1. First, make a new install of the software with your  upgrade CD. Follow the directions above, or refer to your User Manual. Make  sure to install the new software in a new folder, not your old software  installation.<br />
          <br />
          2. After installing the latest version of the software,  locate your old software installation. In the old installation folder,  right-click over the folder that contains the phrase “userdata”. For example, FCAT  Test Maker’s User Data folder will be titled “fcatuserdata2”.<br />
          <br />
          3. Select “Copy”<br />
          <br />
          4. Locate your new software installation, then right-click  and select “Paste”.<br />
          <br />
          5. In the “Confirm Folder Replace” window that pops up,  select “Yes”. The data from your old installation will transfer to the new one.  The software will automatically locate the user data file when you run the  program. This process will transfer all User Data (account information, etc.) to  the new installation.<br />
          <br />
          6. We do recommend keeping the older software installation  on your computer, just in case you may need it in the future.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Installing STAAR Test  Maker as a TAKS Test Maker Customer</strong><br />
          Due to the realignment of standards in Texas, it is not  possible to upgrade from TAKS Test Maker to STAAR Test Maker. You must do a  clean installation of STAAR Test Maker from the CD. You can import User Data  from TAKS Test Maker to STAAR Test Maker.<br />
          <br />
        <strong>Logging in for the  first time.</strong></p>
        <p>Once your software is installed, you first have  to create a user list. You need to log on as the Administrator using “admin”  for both the user name and the password. You are now in the administrative  mode, which allows you to Add, Edit, or Remove Users and to change the administrative  password. We recommend that you change the administrator password immediately.  While in the administrator mode, add one or more users. <br />
  <br />
          For each user enter a  user name and a password. If a user forgets their password at some point in the  future, use the “Edit User” feature to enter a new password. Once you have  finished adding one or more users, exit the program. To log on as the  administrator in the future, use “admin” as the user name and the current  administrator password.

<strong>Why aren't there Non-STAAR TEKS included in STAAR Test Maker?</strong>
<p>We have looked into writing items for the non-STAAR TEKS and have found that the omitted standards assess skills (oral skills, listening skills, recitation, reading silently, etc.) that present challenges when assessing students with paper-and-pencil tests and/or STAAR item types. These TEKS are designed more for in-class assessment and are not quantifiable in the format of the STAAR, which is why they do not appear in the STAAR Assessed Curriculum.</p>
<p>These TEKS are designed more for in-class assessment and are not quantifiable in the format of the STAAR, which is why these TEKS do not appear in the STAAR Assessed Curriculum.</p>
<p>Below is an example of a TEKS that is not assessed on the STAAR. As you can see, it would be virtually impossible to test these skills in a standardized format. These TEKS require guidance from teachers, interaction with classmates, and exposure to various forms of media, all of which are forbidden in regard to the STAAR.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">English Language Arts and Reading, Grade 5</p>
(23) Research/Research Plan. Students ask open-ended research
questions and develop a plan for answering them. Students are expected to:
<br /><br />
<p>(A) Brainstorm, consult with others, decide upon a topic, and
formulate open-ended questions to address the major research topic.</p>
<p>(B) Generate a research plan for gathering relevant information
about the major research question.</p>
<p><strong>How do I view saved  tests?</strong><br />
  You can go back to a previously saved test at a later time  to edit, print additional copies, and/or print an answer key. All saved tests  can be viewed and reformatted, but only tests that have not been used in the Progress  Reporter can be edited. Choose VIEW SAVED TESTS on the Home screen to bring up  a screen that lets you choose a previously created test.<br />
  <br />
  The top of the screen shows all the tests you have created.  When you click a test, a brief description of that test is displayed  underneath. You can edit the test name and date, duplicate, export, or remove  saved tests. You can also import tests via the IMPORT TEST button.<br />
  <br />
  Once you have selected the test you wish to view or edit,  click the NEXT button. If the test you selected has no scores recorded, the  test will load to the Edit Test screen. You can edit, print, and save the test.<br />
  If the test you selected has scores recorded for it, the  test will load to the Test Format screen and cannot be edited. All of the options  will be the same as when the test was originally created. You can keep the  original settings or modify them as desired. When you are done setting the  formatting options, click NEXT to go to the Print Preview and print the test  and/or answer key.<br />
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> Scored and imported tests cannot be edited, however, these  tests can be duplicated, and the duplicate test can then be edited. To  duplicate a test, select the test you wish to duplicate in the VIEW SAVED TESTS  screen and click the DUPLICATE button. Name the test then click OK. You can now  open the duplicate test and edit it as you would any created test.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>How do I score a test  using a scanner?</strong><br />
  The software’s built-in machine scoring option makes grading  tests fast and easy. For instructions on how to install and operate your  scanner, please refer to the documentation that came with the scanner.  Currently, our software supports the Apperson Advantage 1200 scanner. Learn  more about the Apperson Advantage 1200 scanner at www.appersonedu.com<br />
  <br />
  The scanner cannot read Gridded Response, Short Response, or  Extended Response questions. These items must be graded by hand and translated  to the student answer form. On the answer key, these questions have a number  that each GR, SR, and ER corresponds to on the answer key. SR and ER questions  use blanks 61-75, and GR questions use blanks 76-90. For GR questions, mark a  '0' for an incorrect answer and a '1' for a correct answer. For SR and ER  questions, mark the number that corresponds with the student's score as graded  with the SR and ER scoring rubrics, which are provided in the answer key.<br />
  To machine-score a test, click the PROGRESS REPORTER button  on the software’s Home screen. Click SCORE A TEST USING A SCANNER in the Scores  menu. Select the class you would like to open, and then select the test you  would like to score to bring up the Scan Results screen. Valid tests that were  created to be scored with machine scoring are listed in bold.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> Students must be entered in the Progress Reporter before  scanning their test. If the scanner does not recognize the student number, the  form will not be scanned.<br />
  Insert a student answer form into the scanner to grade the  test. The Apperson Advantage 1200 scanner only scans one form at a time.  Stacking a group of forms and passing them through the scanner will only result  in the first test form being scored.<br />
  <br />
  The results are automatically tabulated and appear on the  screen. You can choose to clear any or all results or save the results to the  Progress Reporter. You must click SAVE/DONE to save the results. Once saved to  the Progress Reporter, you can review and edit each student's test scores and  print reports. All Progress Reporter features are available for scanned test  results.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>How do I score a test  manually?</strong><br />
  To enter scores for tests manually, click SCORE A TEST  MANUALLY from the Scores menu. You will be asked to select the class you would  like to begin scoring. Then, you will be asked to select a test to score. Every  time you print and save a test from within the software, an entry is made in a  master list of tests. Essential information about the test you printed is  stored in the list—type of test, subject and grade, number of questions,  benchmarks or standards used on the test, answer key, etc.<br />
  You will then be taken to a screen that lists the class  roster. There are two columns: “Students Without Results” and “Students With  Results”. The Students Without Results column lists all students in the class  whose tests have not been scored. Once the test is scored, the student's name  will automatically move to the Students With Results column.<br />
  <br />
  To enter a result:<br />
  Select one student from the list and click the ENTER RESULT  button, or simply double-click the student's name. This will take you to the  Enter Result screen. Here you can enter the date that the student took the test  along with each answer from their bubble sheet. If a student did not answer a  question, leave the field blank.<br />
  If you have already graded the student's bubble sheet by  hand, use the FILL CORRECT button to automatically enter the correct answer for  each question into each field. <br />
</p>
<p> Then, go back and enter the incorrect responses  made by the student. Click the SCORE button to calculate and display the final  test score. The software knows the strands and benchmarks of each question and  will automatically record each question's answer for tracking purposes. Click  OK to exit. If you forget to click the SCORE button and leave the grading  screen, the score will be automatically calculated for you, and you will not  lose your work.<br />
  <br />
  If you need to edit a student's score, select the student  and then click the EDIT RESULT button. This will take you back to the Enter  Result screen where you can revise and recalculate the test score.<br />
  To remove  a result:<br />
  You may decide that you no longer want to include a test in  a student's records. To remove a test result, select the student from the  Students With Results column and click the REMOVE RESULT button. Because there  is no way to undo this action, the program will always ask to make sure you  want to remove the test result before completing the command.<br />
  <br />
  If you would like to remove the test results for all  students in the class, simply click the REMOVE ALL RESULTS button. Again, since  this action cannot be undone, the program will always ask to make sure you want  to remove the test results before completing the command.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>How do I use the  Scanning Utility?</strong><br />
  When you open the Scanning Utility, the program will  automatically search for an Apperson scanner. After locating the scanner, the  utility is ready for scanning. The Status window will read, &quot;Insert the  first form to begin scanning.&quot;<br />
  Scan your tests as you normally would using an Apperson  scanner. The student IDs of the scanned tests will appear in the lower window.  You can select a result to clear it, or you can clear all results from that  session, if needed.<br />
  <br />
  When you are finished scanning your tests, click COPY  RESULTS TO CLIPBOARD. This stores the results on your computer's clipboard in  order for them to be imported into the Progress Reporter.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you wish to store the results to import at another time or  location, open any text editor such as Notepad or Wordpad and paste the results  in a blank document. Save the document as a text file. When you would like to  import the results from this file, open the file, select all of the contents of  the file, and copy it to the clipboard by using the 'Copy' command. Open the  Progress Reporter in the software, click IMPORT SCORES FROM SCAN UTILITY, and  import from the clipboard as you normally would. (See the next section for  further instruction on importing scores from the Scanning Utility.)<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Importing Scores from  the Scanning Utility</strong><br />
  Start the software, if it is not already running. Open the  Progress Reporter and click IMPORT SCORES FROM SCAN UTILITY. Select the class  and test for which you wish to import scores and click OK. This takes you to  the Import Scan Scores screen.<br />
  <br />
  On this screen, enter the date of the test and select your  warning options. You can select to ignore students whose IDs are not in the  current class, which is helpful if you scanned results for multiple classes  with the same test. If all tests scanned are for the same class, it is helpful  to leave this warning on to ensure that all of your students correctly filled  in their student IDs on their scan forms.<br />
  You can also select to ignore missing results for  gridded-response and short- and extended-response questions. These options  instruct the program to bypass checking for answers in the corresponding blanks  on the answer forms for those types of questions. This is helpful if the  results for those questions have not yet been inputted on the answer forms.<br />
  <br />
  Once your options are set, click IMPORT FROM THE CLIPBOARD.  The list of students with imported results will appear below. Click SAVE/DONE  to save these results into the Progress Reporter. Your results can now be  viewed and edited along with all other results. If you wish to discard the  results and not save them in the Progress Reporter, simply click CANCEL.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>How do I print color  reports?</strong><br />
  Saving and Printing your reports is done from your browser.  To save a report, simply select 'Save' or 'Save As' from the 'File' menu of the  browser, and save it wherever you like.<br />
  Before printing a report, you will need to set up your  browser to print background colors in order to see the coloring in the reports.<br />
  If using Internet Explorer, click 'Tools' in the 'File'  menu, then select 'Internet Options'. Click the 'Advanced' tab on the right of  the window, scroll down to the 'Printing' section, and select 'Print background  colors and images'. Click 'Apply' or 'OK' to save your settings. You will only  have to do this once.<br />
  If using Firefox, click 'File' and then 'Page Setup' in your  browser. Then, select 'Print Background' and click 'OK' to save this setting.<br />
  You may also want to set your browser to print in landscape  mode for certain reports (e.g. Student Answers) in order to get all of the  information on the page. This will depend on how many questions are on the test  and how expansive the report is. For both Internet Explorer and Firefox, the  landscape option can be selected by clicking on 'Page Setup' in the 'File'  menu, then selecting the landscape orientation.<br />
  Your browser will save your settings on subsequent uses. If  you are using a public or group computer that does not allow the saving of  browser settings, you may have to set this again the next time you open the  browser to print a report.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> You can open saved reports in MS Excel and use the data to  make bar graphs, line charts, scatter plots, etc.</p>
